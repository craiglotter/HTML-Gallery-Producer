HTML Gallery Producer
=====================

HTML Gallery Producer is designed to quickly generate a simple single page image gallery for all the image files contained in a user-specified folder. The file names are used as the text descriptors for the images. 

The image thumbnail height or width can be adjusted and the resulting thumbnails are saved as .jpg files, all suffixed with '_gthumb.jpg'.

Note that the gallery generation is non-recursive and the HTML file is saved as 'gallery.htm' in the parent directory of the image directory.
